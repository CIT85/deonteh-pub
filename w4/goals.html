    <p>Over the past few years Academics has been a major thing in my life for both the good and the bad. Since a kid I have always had dreams of being the first of my family to graduate college but this path has not been easy. unfortunately, for me it seems that when in school I always experience something tramatic that keeps me from staying on track and reaching that end goal, but now I am completely determined to strive for success, getting everything I deserve.  </p>
    <p>My goals now for Academics is to gain as much knowledge within the Computer Information Technology field and put my skills to the test. I want to complete my associates degree in Web Development at Fresno City College and use that to aquire a job in that field which slowly working towards my Bachelors. </p>

    <p>I have many many personal goals because I belive in setting and completing at least ONE personal goal every day. However some of my major personal goals would really just be getting a well paid job and building a family that is full of love and progression.</p>
